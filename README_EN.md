### Q&A
Q:  What is the difference between ThePit Premium and ThePit from MrDarkNess462/Her Zaqaryan?

A:  Well, essentially, this project is a branch based on ThePitPremium, which inherits the features from ThePitPremium and adds more content, and we are doing our best to optimize its performance loss.

Q:  Is it different from other ThePitPremium branches?

A:  As this project is in an open source state, you can download the code to your computer and make modifications yourself. We are working to keep the code as consistent as possible with the original project, and we conclude that the lifecycle of this project will be longer than expected.

Q:  When will the code repository become private?

A:  This code repository will never be converted to private status unless our authorization is revoked by the original production team.

Q:  I'm not sure how to compile this plugin

A:  We release a version during each major update, which includes a jar file that you can directly download and use through the Release page.

Q:  I want to contribute code to the project

A:  We welcome everyone to contribute code to this project. When you contact the development team and explain your purpose, we will process your request.
